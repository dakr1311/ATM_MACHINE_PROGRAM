--The code starts with a declaration of variables.

--The first variable is the int balance, which will be used to keep track of how much money is in the account.

--The second variable is an int called deposit, which will be used to store the amount that was deposited into the account.

--The next line declares a function called checkpin.

--This function takes one argument: pin, which stores the user's PIN number and returns true if it matches 1221 or false otherwise.

--If it does not match 1221 then control jumps back up to where they entered their PIN number and prints "Please enter valid PIN" before going back down again to checkpin.

--Next comes a loop that asks for input from users on what their desired withdrawal amount should be (25000).

--Then it calculates out how much money would have been left over after withdrawals were made based on this information (balance-amount).

--It also checks whether there are enough funds left in the account by comparing balance against 25000; if there are more than 25000 then control goes back up to where they entered their desired withdrawal amount and prints "There are no available funds."

--Otherwise control goes down again until all amounts have been calculated and printed out at which point program execution ends because there are

--The code is a program that asks for the user to enter their pin and then checks if it's valid.

--If it isn't, the program prints out an error message and exits.

--The code starts with a defaultcontinu: printf("Enter your choice :"); scanf("%d",&choice); switch(choice) { case 1: //checke balance printf("Your balance is %d",balance); } The code then asks the user if they want to continue with the service. If they say yes, it will ask them for their choice again and go back to the first line of code.

--The code is a switch statement. It will ask the user for their choice and then execute one of two different actions based on that choice. The first case, "1", tells the program to continue with the service.

--The code starts with a printf statement that displays the text "Invalid choice". The code then checks to see if the user has chosen 1 or 2. If they have, it continues on and prints out the message "Your balance is $1,000." If they haven't chosen either of those options, it prints out an error message and breaks from the program. The first thing this code does is print a prompt asking for input from the user: Enter your choice : Next, it reads in their input using scanf() . It then uses that number as an argument to another function called deposit . This function takes in two arguments: amount and balance . The amount argument is what you want to deposit into your account. The balance argument will be whatever was left over after you made your deposit (in our case 0). After making this call to deposit , we print out some information about how much money was deposited into our account followed by a question asking whether or not we want to continue with service.

--The code is a loop that asks the user to choose between two options. The first option is to continue with the service, and the second option is to stop.
